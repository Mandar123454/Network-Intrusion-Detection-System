Install Prerequisites:
1) Make sure you have Npcap installed (required for packet sniffing on Windows).
2) Install the Python libraries:
    pip install scapy pandas matplotlib

## Start the NIDS:
1) Open a terminal as Administrator and run:
cd "e:\Internships and Projects\CyberSecurity CodeAlpha Internship\Internship Work\Projects\Network Intrusion Detection System\python_nids"
2) python nids.py

## Generate Different Traffic: To see more bars on your graph, try:
1) Ping: Open a new terminal and run ping 8.8.8.8. This should trigger the "ICMP Ping Detected" rule.
2) HTTP: Visit a non-secure website (e.g., http://example.com) to trigger the "HTTP Traffic Detected" rule.

## Visualize Results:
In a separate terminal, run:
1) cd "e:\Internships and Projects\CyberSecurity CodeAlpha Internship\Internship Work\Projects\Network Intrusion Detection System\visualization"
2) python dashboard.py
